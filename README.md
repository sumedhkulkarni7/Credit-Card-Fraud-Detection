# Credit-Card-Fraud-Detection

In this project, we will be using Machine Learning Techniques to detect Fraud. We will be using: 


# Supervised Techniques:
1. Logistic Regression
2. Classification Trees
3. Naive Bayes Classifier 


# Unsupervised Techniques:
1. Local Outlier Factor (LOF)
2. Isolation Forest Algorithm

Deep Learning Techniques to detect fraudulent activities will aldo be used. They are:

# Supervised Deep Learning
1. Artificial Neural Network

# Unsupervised Deep Learning
1. Self Organizing Maps

There is a hybrid Deep Learning model which is a combination of the Self Organizing maps and artificial neural network
